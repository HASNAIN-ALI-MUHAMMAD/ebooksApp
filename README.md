---19 May goals:
----- the readoingfile as pdf was done ...
----- the questions answer part in the pdf reader remains
----- the dashboard still needs to be fixed( a lot it looks awful)

the roadmap is to make an app that helps reader read with ai...
-- upload books/files/papers in pdf format...
-- read as pdf with ai
----summary
----questions
---- store the questions history with the book id...
---- designg a books page where the user can see the books detail as well the past reads the questions asked and the answers... etc
---- state management for the whole app...
   ------------ohhhh its getting more and more complex-----------------



we will extract the pdf text and provide/feed in the context window for ais response and the usre can then just ask any questions about he book or pdf ...
