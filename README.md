Things that are completed and may need just a lookup :
1.The login page and setup except for the email and auth...(prob. some ui changes that i will be doing at the end anyways...)
2.The pdf and epub reader are good to go but needs some more robust ui changes...and some functionalities.
3.The book uploading by the user is not bad ... prob some ui changes there as well


Things to be done :\
1.The main page needs a complete ui change ...
2.Adding books category and to improve search and filtering...
3.User dashboard and user-uploaded books schema in mdb.
4.Cache and state management...
5.Middleware...
5.Make a better epub reader and maybe make it the main reader due to its flexibility and ease of book download...
5.Need to upload the epubs from github to supabase.

Over all tech stack:
1.Primarily Next.js
    Tailwind
    JS
2.MongoDB
3.Supabase
4.NextAuth
5.Nodemailer for the login code emails (WILL UPDATE TO MAILTRAIN/someother FOR PRO)
6.And some other basic ui libs(mui,toastify etc... will try more)
